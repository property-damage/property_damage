  PropertyDamage: A stateful property-based testing framework for Elixir.

  PropertyDamage combines the power of property-based testing with stateful system
  testing, allowing you to verify that your system behaves correctly under any
  sequence of operations.

  ## Overview

  Traditional property-based testing generates random inputs and verifies properties
  hold for all inputs. Stateful property-based testing extends this by generating
  random *sequences of operations* (commands) and verifying that the system under
  test (SUT) behaves correctly throughout the entire sequence.

  ## Key Concepts

  - **Commands**: Operations that can be executed against the SUT (create, update, delete, etc.)
  - **Model**: Defines what commands are available and how state is tracked
  - **Projections**: Pure state reducers that process commands and events to maintain state
  - **Adapters**: Bridge between the test framework and the actual SUT
  - **Refs**: Symbolic placeholders for entity IDs, resolved during execution

  ## Two-Phase Execution

  PropertyDamage uses a two-phase execution model:

  1. **Symbolic Phase**: Generate a sequence of commands with symbolic refs
  2. **Concrete Phase**: Execute commands against the SUT, resolving refs to real values

  This separation enables powerful shrinking of failing test cases while maintaining
  the dependency relationships between commands.

  ## Basic Usage

      defmodule MyModelTest do
        use ExUnit.Case
        use PropertyDamage

        @model MyApp.TestModel
        @adapter MyApp.TestAdapter

        property_damage "system maintains invariants" do
          max_commands: 50,
          max_runs: 100
        end
      end

  ## Architecture

  The framework consists of several layers:

  - **Tier 0 (Core Types)**: Ref, Command, Projection, Model behaviours
  - **Tier 1 (Execution)**: Adapter, EventQueue, InjectorAdapter, Executor
  - **Tier 2 (Shrinking)**: Validator, Shrinker, dependency graph
  - **Tier 3 (Integration)**: Main API, ExUnit integration, validation

  See the individual module documentation for detailed information on each component.
